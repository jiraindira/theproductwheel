It’s handy for dogs who do better with softer meals, picky eaters who need a bit more smell-and-sauce motivation, or mixing into dry kibble to make it more appealing.

## Intro

Getting a new dog is a lot like moving house: you think you need one sensible thing, and suddenly you’re comparing lamb-and-rice kibble at midnight while your phone is covered in paw prints. Meanwhile your dog is thriving on chaos, eating something weird off the pavement, and looking at you like you’re the one who needs training.

This is a short, practical list for UK shoppers—stuff that helps with the daily basics: food, toilet logistics, teeth, treats, and the occasional “why is their tummy doing that?” moment. No fussy gadgets, no drama—just the boring kind of useful you’ll still appreciate on a rainy Tuesday.

## How this list was chosen

I picked these with the “new dog chaos” phase in mind: simple stuff you’ll actually use, not gadgets you’ll side-eye from the corner.

- Focused on everyday basics: food, toilet training, poo bags, dental care, digestion, and small training treats
- Chose items that are easy to keep up with on a normal week (no fiddly routines or extra equipment)
- Looked for clear, practical formats: big-value dry food bags, wet food for easy meals, powders/supplements you can add to meals, and ready-to-grab chews
- Prioritised UK-available options that won’t require detective work to source or replace
- Included a mix of “solve a problem fast” picks (pads, poo bags) and “quiet long-game” helpers (fibre, dental support)

## Intro

Buying an electric heater should be a quick “cold room, fixed” situation. Somehow it turns into comparing fins, oscillation angles, and whether a “smart glass panel” is a lifestyle choice.

If you’re shopping in the UK and just want to stay warm without turning your living room into a sauna (or a trip hazard), this is for you. Here’s a short, practical list of features to look for—using real-world examples like ceramic tower heaters (Dimplex DXSTG25), mini fan heaters (Pro Breeze 2000W), oil-filled radiators (DeLonghi TRDX41025E, PureMate 2500W), a couple of Dreo options, and a WiFi glass panel heater from Devola.

## How this list was chosen

I picked these heaters the way most of us actually shop: by filtering out the drama and keeping the useful stuff.

- Stuck to UK-available models from recognisable brands (and avoided the no-name “too cheap to be true” corner).
- Covered the main heater types (ceramic fan/tower, oil-filled radiator, panel) because they behave differently in real rooms.
- Prioritised safety and sanity features: tip-over protection, overheat cut-out, stable bases, and sensible controls.
- Looked for comfort basics like thermostats, timers, and oscillation/remote control where it helps (so you’re not babysitting it).
- Included a range of power levels (1500W–2500W) to suit everything from “desk-side boost” to “cold living room at 7pm”.
- Noted convenience extras like Wi‑Fi on the panel heater, without pretending they replace the heating basics.

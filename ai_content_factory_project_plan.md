# AI Content Factory – Project Plan & Operating Contract

## Project Goal & Strategic Intent

### What we are building

The AI Content Factory is a **general-purpose, spec-driven content generation system** designed to service **multiple clients**, across **multiple use cases**, using a **single, shared engine**.

It is not an affiliate engine, a blog generator, or an email writer.

It is a **content compiler**:

* Clients declare *what* they want (intent, form, persona, domain)
* The system deterministically produces content that satisfies those constraints
* Invalid or incoherent configurations fail fast

### Core objectives

1. **Serve multiple clients safely**

   * Each brand is isolated via configuration, not code
   * No client-specific forks
   * No leakage of tone, logic, or assumptions between brands

2. **Support multiple content use cases**

   * Product recommendations (affiliate and non-affiliate)
   * Thought leadership
   * Educational content
   * Digests and future formats

3. **Decouple content thinking from delivery**

   * Email, blog, LinkedIn, website, and future channels are delivery adapters
   * Delivery never changes the content’s meaning or reasoning

4. **Eliminate implicit decisions**

   * No agent infers intent, tone, persona, depth, or structure
   * All decisions are declared explicitly and validated

5. **Prioritise quality and trust over flexibility**

   * Hard fails only
   * No overrides
   * No “best effort” generation

### What success looks like

* A new client can be onboarded via YAML only
* The same engine can power:

  * an affiliate product site
  * an executive thought-leadership brand
  * a weekly email briefing
* The system scales by **adding configuration**, not code
* Content quality degrades *never silently*

This document is the **single source of truth** for how this project is executed by agents.
It defines **milestones, tasks, definitions of done, and operating rules**.

This file is intended to be handed directly to an agent.

## 0. Key Decisions (Locked)

These decisions are final unless this plan is explicitly revised.

* **Validation:** Unit tests only (v1)
* **Persistence:** BrandContextArtifact persisted as JSON on disk
* **Source fetching:** Live URL fetching is allowed (read-only)
* **HTTP User-Agent:** Deterministic and fixed to `AIContentFactoryFetcher-1.0`
* **Robots.txt compliance:** Evaluate robots for User-Agent `AIContentFactoryFetcher-1.0`; if disallowed, hard‑fail (no bypass)
* **Repo strategy:** Single repo, modularised (no fork yet)
* **Date validation:** Uses local system time (system clock); past dates hard‑fail
* **Topics:** Allowlist-only (auto-pick, if used, must choose from the allowlist)
* **Disclaimers:** Required disclaimers must be present; missing disclaimers hard‑fail
* **Products (v1):** Manual links only (no automatic product retrieval via affiliate APIs)
* **Products scope:** `products` is present only when the intent/form involves products; otherwise null/omitted
* **Product URLs (hard-fail):** Product URLs must be non-blank and valid absolute `http://` or `https://` URLs; invalid URLs hard-fail and must not be auto-fixed
* **Product recommendation shape (operator-controlled):** Product recommendation blog posts are a **Top X** format in v1; this is a global/operator decision (not client-configurable)

  * Operator config knob (proposed): `operator.product_recommendation_blog_format = top_x`
  * Future formats may be added, but must remain operator-controlled (clients must not be able to switch formats)
* **Picks section (Top X, hard-fail):** Top X product recommendation outputs must include a `picks` section
* **Thought leadership links:** Allowed; no special handling (treated as normal links/citations under the same fetch + robots rules)
* **ContentArtifact contract:** **Robust** (includes structured claims, sources, and compliance checklists)

Rationale:

* Unit tests are sufficient for a compiler-style system at this stage
* JSON artifacts provide determinism, debuggability, and cacheability
* Live fetching is required to avoid manual content drift
* Forking early adds coordination cost without upside

## 1. Agent Operating Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

These rules apply globally.

### 1.1 Milestone Execution

* The agent **must not start a new milestone without explicit user approval**
* At the end of each milestone, the agent must:

  * Mark all tasks as completed or not completed
  * Update this plan file to reflect completion (task checkboxes + “Next Action”)
  * Explicitly confirm the Definition of Done is met
  * List any discovered but unexecuted work

* Each milestone that changes behavior must include **new or updated unit tests** that cover the new rules/contract.
* A milestone is not "complete" until `python -m unittest` is run and green.

### 1.2 Git Discipline

* One milestone = one or more atomic commits
* The agent must:

  * Commit all work before requesting approval for the next milestone
  * Provide clear commit messages
  * Confirm a clean working tree
* **No work begins on the next milestone until commits are complete**

### 1.3 Scope Control

* No silent scope expansion
* If a task materially expands, the agent must:

  * Stop
  * Explain why
  * Ask for approval

### 1.4 Validation First

* Invalid config must fail **before** generation
* No inference, no auto-correction, no fallbacks

### 1.5 Progress Tracking

All tasks must be tracked using:

* `[ ]` Not started
* `[x] Completed
* `[!]` Blocked / needs decision

* [x] Add example ContentArtifact output JSON (`content_factory/examples/`)

### Robust ContentArtifact Contract (v1)

The ContentArtifact is the **canonical compiled output** of a run. Delivery adapters may **format** it for different channels/destinations, but must not change meaning, add claims, reorder reasoning, or invent content.

#### Top-level fields

* `artifact_version` (string): Contract version (e.g. `"1.0"`).
* `brand_id` (string)
* `run_id` (string): Unique run identifier.
* `generated_at` (ISO timestamp)

#### Spec metadata (echo of inputs)

* `intent` (enum)
* `form` (enum)
* `domain` (enum)
* `content_depth` (enum, fixed per brand)
* `audience`:

  * `primary_audience` (enum)
  * `audience_sophistication` (enum)
* `persona`:

  * `primary_persona` (enum)
  * `persona_modifiers` (list[enum])
  * `science_explicitness` (enum)
  * `personal_presence` (enum)
  * `narration_mode` (enum)

#### Structured content (required)

* `sections` (list[Section])

Section structure requirements are intent/form dependent.

For **Top X product recommendation** outputs, `sections` must include a `picks` section.

Section

* `id` (string): Stable identifiers such as `intro`, `how_chosen`, `picks`, `alternatives`, `closing`.
* `heading` (string | null)
* `blocks` (list[Block])

Block

* `type` (enum): `paragraph` | `bullets` | `numbered` | `callout` | `quote` | `divider`
* `text` (string | null): For paragraph/callout/quote.
* `items` (list[string] | null): For bullets/numbered.
* `meta` (dict | null): Optional formatting hints (never required for meaning).

#### Products (conditional)

* `products` (list[Product] | null): Present only when intent involves products.

In v1, product entries (including URLs) must be provided explicitly as manual inputs.

Product URL rules:

* URLs must be non-blank strings
* URLs must be valid absolute `http://` or `https://` URLs
* Invalid URLs must hard-fail validation; do not auto-correct or guess

Product

* `pick_id` (string)

* `title` (string)

* `url` (string): Non-blank absolute `http(s)` URL

* `rating` (float | null)

* `reviews_count` (int | null)

* `provider` (string | null)

* `pick_copy` (dict[pick_id, list[Block]] | null): Copy blocks mapped to each pick.

#### Publishable rationale (required when applicable)

* `rationale`:

  * `how_chosen_blocks` (list[Block])
  * `selection_criteria` (list[string])

This is **not** chain-of-thought. It is publishable, reader-facing reasoning (e.g. “How this list was chosen”, “Skip it if…” criteria).

#### Claims (robust QA support)

* `claims` (list[Claim])

Claim

* `id` (string)
* `text` (string)
* `claim_type` (enum): `fact` | `inference` | `opinion` | `advice`
* `requires_citation` (bool)
* `supported_by_source_ids` (list[string])

#### Sources (for traceability)

* `sources` (list[Source])

Source

* `source_id` (string)
* `kind` (enum): `url` | `file`
* `ref` (string): URL or file path
* `purpose` (enum): aligns with `brand_sources.source_purpose`
* `notes` (string | null)

#### Compliance & validation checklist (hard-fail expectations)

* `checks`:

  * `matrix_validation_passed` (bool)
  * `brand_policy_checks_passed` (bool)
  * `required_sections_present` (bool)
  * `products_present_when_required` (bool)
  * `citations_present_when_required` (bool)
  * `topic_allowlist_passed` (bool)
  * `required_disclaimers_present` (bool)
  * `robots_policy_passed` (bool)
  * `disallowed_claims_found` (list[string])

Adapters must refuse to render if `checks.*_passed` is false.

### Definition of Done

* Brand and request files can be validated without running generation
* No implicit defaults exist
* All enums are documented
* Example configs are valid

---

## 🧪 MILESTONE 2: Validation Engine

**Goal**
Fail fast with precise, human‑readable errors.

### Tasks

* [x] Implement Pydantic models for all schemas (`content_factory/models.py`)
* [x] Enum enforcement everywhere
* [x] Illegal matrix validation (`content_factory/validation.py` + `ai_content_factory_schema.yaml`)
* [x] Brand source requirement validation (`content_factory/models.py`)
* [x] Domain → persona validation (`content_factory/validation.py`)
* [x] Unit tests for valid and invalid configs (`tests/test_content_factory_validation.py`)

### Definition of Done

* No invalid config reaches any agent
* Errors point to exact fields
* Matrix violations are explicit
* Date fields are validated against local system time
* Topic selection is validated as allowlist-only
* Unit tests cover all failure classes

---

## 🧠 MILESTONE 3: Brand Understanding & Source Ingestion

**Goal**
Convert raw brand sources into a deterministic BrandContextArtifact.

### Why live URL fetching is required

* Brand sites evolve
* Manual copy/paste drifts silently
* Authority content must reflect current positioning

### Tasks

* [x] Define `BrandContextArtifact` schema (`content_factory/brand_context.py`)
* [x] Implement source loader (public URLs + local files) (`content_factory/brand_context.py`)
* [x] Enforce `robots.txt` compliance per configured User-Agent (hard-fail on disallow)
* [ ] Extract:

  * key terminology
  * positioning statements
  * allowed / disallowed claims
  * voice signals
* [x] Extract:

  * key terminology
  * positioning statements
  * allowed / disallowed claims (v1: placeholder signals only)
  * voice signals (v1: lightweight HTML-derived signals)
* [x] Persist artifact as JSON per brand (`content_factory/brand_context.py`)
* [x] Manual refresh only (v1) (`scripts/build_brand_context.py`)

### Definition of Done

* Writing agents never read raw URLs
* Brand understanding is cached and repeatable
* Missing, unreachable, or robots.txt‑disallowed sources hard‑fail (evaluated for `AIContentFactoryFetcher-1.0`)

---

## 🔁 MILESTONE 4: Pipeline Refactor (Spec‑Driven)

**Goal**
Remove all implicit logic from the content pipeline.

### Tasks

* [x] Refactor pipeline to accept Brand + Request only (`scripts/run_content_factory.py`)
* [x] Deterministic intent → form → persona routing (`content_factory/compiler.py`)
* [x] Inject BrandContextArtifact into agents (`content_factory/compiler.py`)
* [x] Remove agent‑side guessing (no LLM; structure and metadata are spec-driven)
* [x] Update QA and repair agents to validate against specs (`content_factory/artifact_validation.py`)

### Definition of Done

* Same inputs always produce same outputs
* Agents never choose tone, depth, or structure
* Pipeline is entirely declarative

---

## 📦 MILESTONE 5: Delivery Adapters

**Goal**
Decouple generation from formatting and destinations.

### Dependency

* Depends on Robust `ContentArtifact` contract defined in Milestone 1

### Tasks

* [x] Define `ContentArtifact` output contract (done in Milestone 1)
* [x] Blog adapter (Astro‑compatible markdown)
* [x] Email adapter (export-only: subject/preheader/body_html/body_text; no direct sending in v1)
* [x] LinkedIn adapter (long‑form text)
* [x] Enforce destination rules from matrix (adapter target matching + request validation)

### Definition of Done

* One ContentArtifact feeds all adapters
* Adapters never rewrite meaning or tone
* Destination constraints are enforced

---

## 🛠️ MILESTONE 6: Operational Tooling & Docs

**Goal**
Make the system usable and safe.

### Tasks

* [x] CLI: onboard a new client (scaffold brand YAML + request YAML + folders) (`content_factory/onboarding.py`, `content_factory/cli.py`)
* [x] CLI: validate brand files (`content_factory/cli.py`)
* [x] CLI: validate run requests (`content_factory/cli.py`)
* [x] CLI: execute a run (`content_factory/cli.py`)
* [x] Onboarding documentation (`docs/content_factory_onboarding.md`)
* [x] Error reference guide (`docs/content_factory_errors.md`)
* [x] Project README (`README.md`)

### Definition of Done

* A new brand can be onboarded without code changes
* A new brand can be onboarded via CLI + YAML (no manual file copying)
* Invalid configs fail before runtime
* Docs reflect actual behaviour

---

## 🧠 MILESTONE 7: Multi-Intent Agents (Neutral Content Generation)

**Goal**
Make the “agent stack” correct for non-affiliate use cases by separating intent/form-specific writing from legacy affiliate/blog assumptions.

### PR-style summary (what shipped)

* Added deterministic intent/form routing and generation paths (thought leadership vs product recommendation)
* Wired generation into the Content Factory `run` pipeline (compile → generate → validate → render)
* Added unit tests to prevent buying-guide leakage in thought leadership and to enforce product gating
* Added a legacy agent bias/reuse audit to document what should not run for non-affiliate intents

### Problem statement

The legacy `agents/` pipeline is optimized for product/blog posts (picks sections, product count, "Skip it if" guidance, buying-guide phrasing).
As we broaden beyond product affiliate blogging, we must prevent accidental buying-guide bias from leaking into thought leadership, email, and LinkedIn.

### Tasks

* [x] (added) Audit legacy `agents/` + `pipeline/` and classify which components are product/blog-specific vs reusable (`docs/legacy_agents_audit.md`)
* [x] (added) Add an explicit intent/form router for any future LLM-driven generation (product vs thought leadership)
* [ ] (added) Define a neutral, content-first generation contract (populate `ContentArtifact.sections/claims/sources` first; adapters format later)
* [x] (added) Implement a thought-leadership writer path that never references products, “picks”, “what to buy”, or affiliate language
* [x] (added) Implement product-recommendation writer path that respects manual products and avoids invented specs/claims
* [ ] (added) Replace/extend QA rules so they’re channel-appropriate (blog vs email vs LinkedIn) and intent/form-appropriate (e.g., `picks` required for Top X product recommendation, irrelevant/forbidden for thought leadership)
* [x] (added) Add unit tests proving: (1) thought leadership outputs contain no buying-guide tokens, (2) product outputs require products, (3) routing is deterministic
* [ ] (added) Update docs to explain the split between legacy affiliate engine and multi-intent content factory

### Definition of Done

* Thought leadership generation is structurally and linguistically non-affiliate by default
* Product recommendation generation remains safe (no invented product facts) and explicitly gated by intent/form
* Unit tests added and `python -m unittest` is green

### Remaining work (to finish M7)

* Define a neutral, content-first generation contract (populate `sections/claims/sources` first; adapters format later)
* Replace/extend QA rules so they’re channel-appropriate (blog vs email vs LinkedIn) and intent/form-appropriate (e.g., `picks` required for Top X product recommendation, irrelevant/forbidden for thought leadership)
* Update docs to explain the split between the legacy affiliate engine and the multi-intent content factory

---

## 🧾 BACKLOG: Affiliate API Product Automation (formerly Milestone 8)

**Goal**
Enable optional automatic product retrieval/enrichment via affiliate APIs.

This backlog item is explicitly **not required** for v1, which remains manual links only.

### Tasks

* [ ] Define a provider-agnostic affiliate API interface (search, lookup, pricing/availability metadata)
* [ ] Implement first provider adapter(s) behind that interface (auth, rate limits, retries, caching)
* [ ] Add “product enrichment” step to turn manual seeds into structured `Product` fields
* [ ] Add deterministic test fixtures + unit tests for API adapters (no live network in tests)
* [ ] Add config switches to keep v1 behavior defaulting to manual links only (API automation opt-in)

### Definition of Done

* Affiliate API automation can be enabled explicitly (opt-in)
* Manual-links-only remains the default behavior
* Unit tests cover adapter behavior without live network calls

---

## 📨 BACKLOG: Single-Recipient Email Sending (Optional) (formerly Milestone 9)

**Goal**
Optionally send an email-ready output to a single client recipient.

This is explicitly **not part of Milestone 5**. Milestone 5 is export-only.

This backlog item is lower priority than neutral multi-intent work (Milestones 6–7).

### Tasks

* [ ] (added) Decide on transport: SMTP vs provider API (SendGrid/Mailgun/etc)
* [ ] (added) Add opt-in send command (e.g. `scripts/send_single_email.py`) that accepts one `--to` address
* [ ] (added) Store credentials via environment variables only (no secrets in repo)
* [ ] (added) Add unit tests with mocked SMTP/provider client (no live email sending in tests)
* [ ] (added) Update docs with setup + safety notes (rate limits, failures, retries)

### Definition of Done

* Email sending is opt-in and single-recipient only
* No recipient list management is implemented or stored
* Tests cover success + failure paths without live network calls

---

## 4. Rules for Plan Evolution

* This plan is **living but controlled**
* If new tasks or milestones are discovered:

  * They must be added here
  * Marked as *added*
  * Approved before execution

---

## 5. Next Action

Milestone 7 is approved. Proceed with implementation.

**→ Continue Milestone 7 (Multi-Intent Agents)**

Suggested order:

1) Define the neutral generation contract
2) Add channel-appropriate QA (per delivery target)
3) Update docs (architecture split + routing rationale)
